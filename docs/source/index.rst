impedance.py
=============

:code:`impedance.py` is a community-driven Python package for making the analysis of electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data easier and more reproducible.
The package currently provides several useful features commonly used in the typical impedance analysis workflow:

- **data ingestion**: functions for importing data from a variety of instruments and file types
- **data validation**: easy-to-use methods for checking measurement validity
- **model fitting**: a simple and powerful interface for quickly fitting models to analyze data
- **model selection**: parameter error estimates and model confidence bounds
- **visualization**: interactive and publication-ready Nyquist and Bode plots

.. note::
  ðŸŽ‰This project started at the `2018 Electrochemical Society (ECS) Hack Week
  <https://www.electrochem.org/233/hack-week/>`_ and has grown from there. ðŸŽ‰

If you have a feature request or find a bug, please feel free to `file an issue <https://github.com/ECSHackWeek/impedance.py/issues>`_ or, better yet, make the code improvements and `submit a pull request
<https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/>`_! The goal is to build an open-source tool that the entire impedance community can improve and use!

User Installation
------------------
The easiest way to install :code:`impedance.py` is from `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/impedance/>`_ using pip:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install impedance

Dependencies
-------------
impedance.py requires:

- Python (>=3.5)
- SciPy (>=1.0)
- NumPy (>=1.14)
- Matplotlib (>=3.0)

Several example notebooks are provided in the :code:`examples/` directory.
Opening these will also require Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.

Examples and Documentation
---------------------------
:doc:`./getting-started` contains a detailed walk
through of how to get started from scratch. If you're already familiar with
Jupyter/Python, several examples can be found in the :code:`examples/` directory
(the `fitting_tutorial.ipynb
<https://github.com/ECSHackWeek/impedance.py/blob/master/docs/source/examples/fitting_example.ipynb>`_
is a great place to start) and the documentation can be found at
`impedancepy.readthedocs.io <https://impedancepy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.
